# DELM: Network Anomaly Detection
The security and reliability of anomaly detections are critical issues in the network securty. Existing methods often employ machine learning techniques and static analysis, which have limitations, such as computational inefficiency and incomplete code analysis. we have used the deep learning method that provides better performance in network security.

# Introduction
We introduce DELM, a comprehensive approach incorporating batch normalization, adaptive feature agregation, N-grams, features selection, 5 layers and a hybrid envornment combining FDNN, BDN, and the adaptive feature agregation to address these challenges of network anomaly detection.

# UNSW-NB15
Implementation of an approach of generating synthetic data to balance UNSW-NB15 network anomaly detection Benchmark dataset using DELM and cGAN.

# Getting Started
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

Python (version 3.7 or higher)
Goglle Colab (latest version)
