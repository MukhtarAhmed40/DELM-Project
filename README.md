# DELM: Network Anomaly Detection
The security and reliability of anomaly detections are critical issues in the network securty. Existing methods often employ machine learning techniques and static analysis, which have limitations, such as computational inefficiency and incomplete code analysis. we have used the deep learning method that provides better performance in network security.

# Introduction
We introduce DELM, a comprehensive approach incorporating batch normalization, feature agregation, N-grams, features selection, different layers and a hybrid deep learning envornment combining FDNN, BDN, and the adaptive feature agregation to address these challenges of network anomaly detection.

# UNSW-NB15
Implementation of an approach of generating synthetic data to balance UNSW-NB15 network anomaly detection Benchmark dataset using DELM and cGAN.

The dataset used for the research are publicly available at https://research.unsw.edu.au/projects/unsw-nb15-dataset
